        What is MTC? Who are the staff? General Information
MTC-My Transportation Company LLC is a Christian owned company founded in October of 2017 by Mark T. Camarena a man who two years previous nearly lost the battle against depression.  He will tell you that one of the major reasons he nearly lost was there was nothing to look forward too. Thinking of how in his deepest darkest hour it seemed no one cared he formed MTC-My Transportation Company LLC. It was originally to be named Mark’s Transportation but Mark want’s you to know it is yours. When you have places to go and people to see think MTC.  The domain name Mtc.me was so important to Mark because he wants you to know it is for you. You think MTC and me.  At MTC we want you to know there are things to look forward to and we are scouring the local area looking for trips that would be fun for you and give you the opportunity to meet others. At MTC we truly care abut our riders.

MTC Mission statement is to provide reasonably priced transportation to planned events whether they be trips to the airport, train station, doctors appointments, sporting events, live entertainment, or create your own. We also take folks to work, can operate carpools and if you know Mark a service he thinks was so needed we will come and help you pick up that large item from Goodwill the next day. MTC will continue to scour the area for trips we think you would like to take, we welcome suggestions and feel free to book your own. You can ride with anyone but ask yourself are they fully insured? Is this there livelihood or just something they do on the side? And finally most importantly do they care about you as a person or are you just another ride? AT MTC we care, this is our livelihood and we are fully insured to transport passengers across state lines.
